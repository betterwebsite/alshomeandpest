                <p class="cs-text">
                    Dealing with rodents in your attic might seem like a minor issue at first, but it can quickly turn into a bigger problem if left unresolved. House mice, in particular, love attics because they’re warm, quiet, and full of materials—like insulation—they can use for nesting and breeding. If you’ve noticed scratching noises overhead or discovered droppings, it’s important to act fast to prevent damage, avoid health risks, and keep your home comfortable and secure.
                </p>
                <h2 class="cs-title">Why Removing and Replacing Insulation Matters</h2>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    When mice make themselves at home, they often soil the insulation with droppings and urine, which not only causes unpleasant odors but also attracts other rodents. That lingering scent signals to new mice that your attic is a good spot to settle in. As part of our attic remediation process, we safely remove the contaminated insulation, then thoroughly clean and sanitize the attic space. This removes bacteria and odors, stops the cycle of infestation, and gives you a fresh start. Afterward, we replace the old insulation with clean, high-quality material that helps regulate your home’s temperature and keeps rodents from finding cozy nesting spots.
                </p>
                <h2 class="cs-title">Exclusion and Ongoing Support</h2>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    Of course, simply cleaning your attic isn’t enough if rodents can still sneak back in. That’s why we also focus on exclusion—sealing up any entry points or gaps that mice might use to get inside. By blocking these pathways, we cut off their access to your home to prevent future infestations. And because we want to make sure they are gone for good, we follow up every month to ensure that no unwelcome visitors have returned. The result? A healthier home, lower risk of damage, and the peace of mind that your attic is truly rodent-free.
                </p>
